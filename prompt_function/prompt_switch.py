Write a solution to the following coding problem:
You are assigned the task of modifying the given code snippet to implement a new function that is related to the original function implemented by the code. Ensure your modified code adheres to the programming language's syntax and logic requirements. Validate your solution against the provided test cases to ensure its accuracy. Note that:
1. Your solution should strictly consist of the corrected code only. 
2. You must wrap your code using ```.

Below is the code snippet that implements a specific function:
{similar_source_code}

It currently performs the operation:
Input: {public_similar_tests_input}
Output: {public_similar_tests_output}

You are required to modify this code to implement a new function that is related to the original one, as detailed below:
Input: {public_target_tests_input}
Output: {public_target_tests_output}

Ensure your modified code passes the provided test case.

### Instruction:
Modify the following code snippet to implement a new specified function, using a step-by-step reasoning process. The process involves analyzing the current code's functionality, identifying necessary changes for the new requirements, and implementing these changes effectively. Follow these steps:

1. **Current Functionality Analysis**: Begin by thoroughly understanding and analyzing the functionality and logic of the current code. Identify the key operations and how they contribute to producing the given output.

2. **Identify New Requirements**: Compare the current functionality with the new function requirements. Highlight the differences in input and output specifications and any additional functionalities that need to be incorporated.

3. **Determine Required Changes**: Based on the analysis, specify the changes needed to adapt the existing code to the new requirements. This includes altering existing logic, adding new logic or functions, and removing unnecessary parts.

4. **Modification Strategy**: Develop a detailed plan for making these changes. This should outline any new algorithms, data structures, or coding constructs required to implement the new functionality while maintaining code efficiency and readability.

5. **Implementation**: Modify the source code according to your strategy. Ensure that the new code accurately implements the desired function and adheres to good coding practices.

6. **Validation**: Validate your modified code using the provided test case. Explain how the new input leads to the expected output, demonstrating the effectiveness of your modifications.
